This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell when using the `sort` function from `Data.List`. The bug arises from attempting to sort a list containing numbers of differing types (e.g., Int and Double).  The solution shows how to correctly handle this by ensuring that all elements in the list share a consistent and comparable type, addressing potential type errors or unexpected behavior during sorting.
